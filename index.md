## Hello!!
My name is James Edwards, and I'm a software developer with [DMI](http://www.dminc.com).

In May of 2017 I graduated as an International Computer Science major at the [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu). My senior thesis was based on identifying hand washing technique based on deep learning. From August 2015 to July 2016 I was able to study abroad in Ulm, Germany at [Hochschule Ulm](http://hs-ulm.de).
    
Some of my other hobbies include learning languages, listening to podcasts, and playing board games with my friends.
