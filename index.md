## Hello!
I am James Edwards, a senior International Computer Science major at the [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu).
I am interested in back-end development, computer security and encryption, and machine learning.
Currently I am doing a senior thesis based on identifying hand washing technique based on deep learning.

From August 2015 to July 2016 I studied abroad in Ulm, Germany at [Hochschule Ulm](http://hs-ulm.de).
    
Some of my other hobbies include learning languages, listening to podcasts, and playing board games with my friends.

My most highly recommended podcasts are:
- [The History of Rome](http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com)
- [Revolutions](revolutionspodcast.com)
- [Congressional Dish](congressionaldish.com)
