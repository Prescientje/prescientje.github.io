# Hello!
I am James Edwards, a senior International Computer Science major at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
I am interested in back-end development, computer security and encryption, and machine learning.
Currently I am doing a senior thesis based on identifying hand washing technique based on deep learning.
    
Some of my other hobbies include learning languages and reading science fiction books.
