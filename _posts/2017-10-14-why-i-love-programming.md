So as you know, I am a software developer by profession. 
I went through four years of college to obtain my degree and accepted a position with DMI in the spring of my senior year.
I also had one internship after my sophomore year with GE Aviation.

But some of you may be asking why I decided to pursue programming or computer science at all.

It all started in middle school when my dad and I built a computer for me. 
He studied computer engineering and has worked in the technology field for most of my life. 
I was initially amazed by the different components of a computer and how they all worked together to make such a previously “magical” device. 
I was also captivated by the operating system and wanted to know how that actually worked to make the mouse and keyboard clicking on a web page into 1s and 0s for the computer to understand. 
Sometime around then I also got a Lego Mindstorms robot for Christmas and was able to mess around with that, which gave me a very small introduction to programming (connecting blocks together to form a program).

Then in 8th grade and in high school I became interested in VEX Robotics. 
The basic idea is that teams make a robot to compete in a game of 2 on 2 with their robots, generally trying to put some kind of object into some kind of goal for some amount of points. 
This kickstarted my interest in technology and gave me an immediate way to develop my interests (and robots are quite cool).

I was also taking pre-engineering classes at my high school, and going through these courses gave me a sneak peek into what engineering is really about. 
I was intrigued and fascinated by all of the different applications we could use (mainly some CAD and wiring diagram tools). From then on I knew I wanted to become an engineer.

I decided to major in computer science because I wanted to focus more on programming than circuit diagrams. 
From my first CS lecture I was hooked. 
I just love how writing some code means that I can make the computer do whatever I want (or at least what I told it to do). 
I am also thankful to understand technology and to be able to not treat it as magic (though some programming topics I've read about definitely do seem like magic). 
I also enjoy the problem-solving nature of programming. 
I like being able to have an idea, think it through code-wise, and then take a shot at making it actually work. 
The logical nature of everything also fits my personality and helps me keep ideas clear in my head as well. 

All in all, programming and computer science just make sense to me. 
During college many people would say “How are you a Computer Science major?!” 
I would have to reply with “How are you a Biochemistry major?!” or “How are you an Electrical Engineering major?!” 
Each person just has some topics which make sense to him or her and some which seem like voodoo. 
I'm thankful that I was able to find my sense early and knew what I wanted to do.
