So last week we covered the accusative prepositions. 
This week it's time for the dative prepositions, which are of course in a table below: 

| German | English |
|---------|--------|
| *aus* | out, out of |
| *au&szlig;er* | except, besides |
| *bei* | at the home/business of |
| *mit* | with |
| *nach* | after, according to |
| *seit* | since, for a time period |
| *von* | from, of |
| *zu* | to |

Since these are "dative" prepositions, what comes after the preposition must be in the dative case.

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I come from the U.S. | *Ich komme aus den Vereinigten Staaten.* |
| I have something for everyone, except you. | *Ich habe etwas f&uuml;r jeder au&szlig;er dir.* |
| We work at his house. | *Wir arbeiten bei seinem Haus.* |
| He is coming with the woman. | *Er kommt mit der Frau.* |
| After school they read books. | *Nach der Schule lesen sie B&uuml;cher.* |
| For years I have eaten only meat. | *Seit Jahren habe ich nur Fleisch gegessen.* |
| He tells us about the country. | *Er erz&auml;hlt uns von dem Land.* |
| It is a pleasure to meet you. | *Es freut mich, Sie kennenzulernen.* |

So now we have 2 of the 3 types of prepositions under our belts. 
Hopefully you are enjoying these lessons so far and will come back to learn more about the German language.
