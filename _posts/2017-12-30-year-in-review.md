It seems crazy to me that this year is basically over.
Seven months ago I graduated from college (which feels like a lifetime ago now) and I moved into an apartment and started my professional career. 
On a political note, it's hard to believe Donald Trump is just about a year into his presidency. 
Bitcoin has also been going wild in the past month, reaching almost $20,000 this month, which is a ridiculous increase from January of this year. 

Each year I like to look back on what happened and I use an amalgamation of goal setting techniques to look ahead to the next year. 
I set four annual goals in the categories of health, wealth, relationships, and lifestyle, and then also make a quick summary of where I'd like to be in 1, 5, and 10 years.

I think setting goals is helpful as I try to improve my life and make a positive impact on others.
Reviewing the year is also fascinating and I am constantly amazed at how much my life changes in a given year. 
I have heard that we overestimate what we can do in a day but underestimate what we can do in a year. 
I completely agree with that sentiment and I think it can go positively or negatively.
People can either get stuck and lose ground over a year without a plan (because they underestimate what they could have done) or they can stay focused and get a metric heck ton* done in a year.
I appreciate making a plan to provide a background focus for my actions.
To me, even the actual making of the plan has value if I never look at it again (though I do put regular events on my calendar to review my goals as I plan out weeks and months).
I would encourage you all to plan out goals for the year and really think through where you would like to be in a year or two. 
No doubt we will all be surprised with where we end up.
