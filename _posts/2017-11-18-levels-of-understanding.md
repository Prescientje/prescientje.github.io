title: "Levels of Understanding"

Starting in college or even high school I started to notice something about how myself and others learned new ideas or concepts. 
It seemed like some people could understand a lesson and follow along, but then be immediately stuck while trying to do a related homework problem. 
Others got some of the problems easily but then needed help on more complex issues, or could not remember the ideas and had to do severe review for a test. 
And there were those few who could instantly understand the concepts which were presented and rarely had any trouble doing homework or tests. 

I thought about this idea more and more during college when I saw many of my classmates really struggle on software projects where we had to apply what was (hopefully) taught in the lectures. 
Many people just said they were stuck and stopped, and even if they were helped, they did not seem to really absorb the information.

I have often heard that you remember 20% of what you hear, 30% of what you read, 60% of what you practice, but 90% of what you teach (percentages obviously vary).
Those levels definitely resonate with me: you can progress from superficial understanding to higher-level and eventually complete understanding. 
Being able to fully explain an idea shows that you yourself understand it and how it interacts or deals with other similar ideas. 

I think it's important to recognize when you only understand an idea superficially and then look for more information to process in order to increase your understanding.
Alternatively you can explain the idea to someone else and then discover what you don't understand about it.

The key is actually understanding the idea of the different levels of understanding though -- it opens you up to recognizing that you have an intermediate understanding of an idea. 
From there you can go about learning more about the idea or asking for help (and hopefully thus gaining understanding through the help or advice you receive). 
Completely thinking through ideas (as well as their effects, and consequences even from those effects) is another way to gain understanding. 

Hopefully this general concept lets you realize why you might still have repeating issues due to incomplete understanding and will let you more concretely increase your understanding on topics in the future.
