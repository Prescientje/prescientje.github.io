I am finding that I have less and less in common with my friends. 
I think part of the problem is that we spent several years apart while we went to separate colleges. 
In high school we spent almost every weekend together, and then in college we probably met up under 20 times total. 
Of course I also spent a year abroad which gave me a lot of time to live on my own, separate even from my college friends, and during that time I developed my own habits, routines, and ideas about what I like to do. 

I think I also am just pretty introverted and I like to keep to myself. 
And it would be almost weird if we just kept hanging out every weekend playing games like we did back in high school. 
I expected that we would gradually have different things that keep us out of each others' lives so much, but I guess it is still hard to reconcile with. 

I just found out that one of my friends is moving across the country for new job and I am very happy for him, but I'm also realizing this could be a long term move. 
I think even moving in different cities can be tough for friendships, let alone across several states.
I know I value my friendships highly, but I am also finding it harder to stay invested in them. 
That's been tricky for me to think through as I have been for the past few days.

At this time I don't have many people nearby that I know beyond my roommates and a few people at work. 
I would like to find some new / other friends, but I am also interested in doing my own things for a while.
I have some plans for books to read and things to learn online, mainly related to languages and programming.

I'm sure these issues are all just part of growing up. 
It's also notable that I have talked to only 3 or 4 of my college friends since I graduated. 
We are also living across the country but I wish I could stay in touch with them more than I have.

I know that part of the problem is related to what I value -- if I don't put the time in, then I don't really value it. 
That is a tough pill to swallow sometimes.
