Last time we covered the modal verbs, such as "can" and "would like to".
I also mentioned that the future tense verb is *werden*, but I would cover that later on.
I think right now is a good time for this topic because it's fairly simple and helps us review the word order we covered last week.
So let's examine the conjugation table.

| to become / will | *werden* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich werde* | *wir werden* |
| *du wirst* | *ihr werdet* |
| *er/sie/es wird* | *sie/Sie werden* |

You hopefully noticed that I translated the verb as "to become / will". Technically it has both meanings.
So if we say "he becomes strong" then that is *Er wird stark* in German. 
The verb also acts as "will" in English (representing the future tense).
So I suppose you can think of it as one fewer conjugation to learn if you're a positive person.
You can also notice that it's irregular in the *du* and *er/sie/es* forms. 

Now let's look at some sample sentences. 
Make sure to remember that the conjugated verb goes in the second position and the other verbs go to the end. 

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I will find the cup. | *Ich werde die Tasse finden.* |
| Of course you will see the dog. | *Nat&uuml;rlich wirst du den Hund sehen.* |
| They will give the dog a bone. | *Sie werden dem Hund einen Kauknochen geben.* |
| We will sleep tomorrow. | *Wir werden morgen schlafen.* |
| He will eat apples on Tuesday. | *Er wird am Dienstag &Auml;pfel essen.* |
| She will make a table next week. | *Sie wird einen Tisch machen.* |
| Ich will be allowed to watch the movie. | *Ich werde den Film schauen d&uuml;rfen.* |

Now we have reviewed the standard German sentence order and can speak about our coming plans in the future tense! 
Tune in next week to learn more about the wonderful German language.
