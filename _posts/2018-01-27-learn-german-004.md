Welcome to part 4 of my Learning German series.

This week I think we should cover something that we possibly should have covered earlier: the verb 'to be.'

So in English we obviously say "I am", "you are", "he / she / it is", and "we / they are". 
Technically this is the conjugation of the verb "to be" in English. 
"Conjugation" is the technically grammar word for changing a verb based on the subject of the sentence.
In German (as usual) it is a bit more complicated than those 4 different words.

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I am | *ich bin* |
| You are (singular) | *du bist* |
| He / She / It is | *er / sie / es ist* |
| We are | *wir sind* |
| You guys are | *ihr seid* |
| They are | *sie sind* |
| You are (formal) |  *Sie sind* |

Note again that the we, they, and you-formal forms are the same. 
This is a very nice aspect of German that simplifies the general conjugation pattern.

So now we can get into some sample practice sentences, and here I can also give you some adjectives to learn.

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I am good. | *Ich bin gut.* |
| You are tired. | *Du bist m&uuml;de.* |
| He is poor. | *Er ist arm.* |
| We are happy. | *Wir sind gl&uuml;cklich.* |
| You guys are sad. | *Ihr seid traurig.* |
| They are hungry | *Sie haben Hunger.* \* |

Now if you want to say "the tired man is hungry" then we have to cover adjective endings. 
Basically, when the adjective comes after the verb, you don't need adjective endings, which makes things much simpler. 
But that's for another lesson. 

\* Here in German you are technically saying "They have hunger", but we can get to that in the future.
Hopefully you weren't too upset at being tricked. I thought I'd throw it in nonetheless.
