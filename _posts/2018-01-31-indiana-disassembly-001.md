## Introduction

This will be the first in a series of posts about topics related to Indiana's state government. 
Indiana is my home state and I have recently become interested in how the government really works thanks to this podcast: [Congressional Dish](http://www.congressionaldish.com). 
I will be roughly following the format of Jen's podcast as I see fit. 

Now for those who don't know (myself included up until last month), Indiana's state government only meets for 3-4 months out of the year. 
There are some summer committees which we will get to, but it's really a part time job. 

There are 100 state representatives and 50 state senators who together form [the Indiana General Assembly](http://iga.in.gov).

For this post I'd like to briefly get introduced to some major themes that will hopefully be resolved during this session.

### Sunday Alcohol Sales

### Legalization of Marijuana

### Handgun Permits

### Infrastructure
