Welcome to part 3 of my Learning German series.

The last two weeks I've been covering some basic grammatical explanations of the German language.

I think this week it would be helpful to go through some common greetings and expressions and briefly explain any grammatical points that may come up.
**Using the language is the key to learning the language.** Practicing the language by speaking is the best way to get the words and structure into your head.

So let's get started.

| English | German | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Hello | *Hallo* | |
| Good day / more formal Hello | *Guten Tag* | day = *der Tag* |
| Good evening | *Wir sehen das Spiel.* | evening = *der Abend*|
| How are you? (informal) | *Wie geht's?* / *Wie geht's dir?* | literally "how goes it for you?" |
| How are you? (formal) | *Wie geht es Ihnen?* | *Ihnen* is the formal form of "to/for you" |
| Where are you? | *Wo bist du?* | |
| I don't care | *Das ist mir egal* | an idiomatic expression basically meaning "everything is equal to me" |
| No idea | *Keine Ahnung* / *Keine Idee* | *die Idee* is the normal word for idea; *Keine Ahnung* is just idiomatic |
| What time is it? | *Wie sp&auml;t ist es?* | literally "how late is it?"; the two dots above the a are called umlauts |
| When are we meeting? | *Wann treffen wir uns?* | *treffen* is a reflexive verb, so this literally asks "when meet we us?" |
| How much is that? | *Wie viel kostet das?* | *kosten* = to cost |

I hope these basic phrases let you get some practice in and I hope you are intrigued enough to continue in learning to speak the German language.
