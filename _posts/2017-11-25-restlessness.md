Lately I have been feeling restless. 

Part of that is because things have not been going perfectly at work -- nothing horrible is happening but I have simply been frustrated recently. 
I would like to have more control of my environment and I would also like to have things just work the first time, but of course that just basically never happens, and these are really unrealistic expectations more than anything else. 
I know that this trouble is only a tiny problem compared to the learning and experiences I have had so far at work and with my coworkers. 
I am very thankful for my job and I am truly blessed to have an occupation that matches with my passion and skills. 


Yet I am still feeling restless. 

I just feel like what I on a day-to-day basis has no effect on anything (which it really doesn't). 
I go to work, come back from work, study French and Chinese, make and eat dinner, and usually go to the gym. 
Then I watch videos on YouTube or read articles on reddit or Hacker News and all of a sudden it's time for bed. 
I am able to see the impact of what I am doing at work, so at least that is fulfulling. 

I want to feel like I am contributing to something else meaningful, I guess. 
I am going through reading books which I own but I have not read yet, so that occupies some time.
I am writing this blog, so that counts for something. 
It is clearly helpful at letting me get out some of my thoughts and ideas.
At the same time I feel like nothing matters. 
I hang out with my friends every fortnight or so, and it is good to get caught up on their lives and have fun as well. 
We have even started a podcast about boardgames, so that has been a nice way to get some content creation going. 

This recent struggle with restlessness has given me a huge appreciation for my job and how it does help to fulfill me, but it's also giving me a warning to avoid getting all of my fulfillment and happiness from my job. 
I'm also gaining understanding of how people all across the U.S. and the rest of the world feel when it comes to working all day and then just being worn out ad infinitum. 
I can easily imagine that one day I act much like my father does currently and come home from work only to watch TV until it's time for bed. 
I desperately want to prevent myself from making that a habit and I hope to find some creative outlets to keep myself occupied after work and contribute to my well-being. 
I have thought of having a side hustle or two but those involve a lot of time and I'm sure I need to think about it more before I commit to something on that sort of scale.
