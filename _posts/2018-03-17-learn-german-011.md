So we have covered both the accusative and dative prepositions so far.
Now it's time for the prepositions which can be both accusative and dative.


| German | English |
|---------|--------|
| *an* | on, above |
| *auf* | on, on top of |
| *hinter* | behind |
| *in* | in, into |
| *neben* | next to |
| *&uuml;ber* | above, over |
| *unter* | under |
| *vor* | before, in front of |
| *zwischen* | between |

The main way you can tell which case you should use is based on the motion or lack of motion in the sentence. 
If the verb implies motion, then the accusative case is used; if there's no motion, use the dative case. 

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| The picture is hanging on the wall. | *Das Bild h&auml;ngt an der Wand.* (dative) |
| I'm on the way. | *Ich bin auf dem Weg.* (dative\*) |
| We are sitting behind the building. | *Wir sitzen hinter dem Geb&auml;ude.* (dative) |
| He is walking into the store. | *Er geht in den Laden.* (accusative) |
| We live next to a library. | *Wir wohnen neben eine Bibliothek.* (accusative) |
| He kicks the ball over the wall. | *Er tritt den Ball &uuml;ber die Wand.* (accusative) |
| The paper is falling under the table. | *Das Papier f&auml;llt unter den Tisch.* (accusative) |
| The children play in front of the house. | *Die Kinder spielen vor dem Haus.* (dative) |
| The girl stands between the man and the woman. | *Das M&auml;dchen steht zwischen dem Mann und der Frau.* (dative) |

Now we've got all 3 types of prepositions in our language toolchest to make more complicated sentences. 
Next time I'll have to think of something new to explain!

\* This sentence is dative because though you are moving on your way, you are staying on the way, not going between ways or something. 
It's a bit technical and *auf dem Weg* is a standard phrase to learn.
