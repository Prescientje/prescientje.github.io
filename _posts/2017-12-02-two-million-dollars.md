Recently I found a reddit thread on r/personalfinance talking about how a user finally had a net worth of over US $2 million, but then claimed he was not yet financially independent. 
My roommates and I then got into a small discussion about what we could or would do with that sum, so I thought I might expound upon that here. 

Firstly I would hope that if I suddenly woke up with 2 million dollars in the bank, I would be willing to donate a large portion of it -- I'm think about 25% initially. 
I would tithe 10% to my church and then find various foundations for the remaining 15%. 

I would put most of the money into an array of retirement / investment / savings account system. 
I have heard that index funds are the way to go because of the low fees, but I would also be interested in trying to find solid stocks and investing specifically in those. 

I would definitely want to pay off my student loan debts and the loans and mortgage of my parents. 
I would also feel obligated to put away money to especially ensure that my family has a solid future financially. 

I am somewhat torn on the idea of quitting my job. 
I am thankful that I do mostly enjoy what I do, and I think I would be extremely bored if I just quit all of a sudden, especially when I just started my career this year. 
I think I would try to keep everything normal for a few months and then maybe try to work only 30-35 hours a week instead of 40. 
On the other hand, I would also take every opportunity I could to travel and see the world as much as I can. 
I could also use the money to start a tutoring business, which is one of my eventual goals. 

All in all I would relish the freedom I would have knowing that I can provide for myself for virtually the rest of my life. 
I always hear about lottery winners become broke soon after their massive winnings and part of that honestly breaks my heart. 
I can imagine that they could get caught up in a bit of a spending spree but I would hope that they would eventually come to their senses before all of the money is gone. 
That kind of money should be used to secure future freedom and not just be blown on luxury items. 

I have also heard that having more money just magnifies the kind of person you are and does not necessarily make you more or less selfish. 
I know my plan was actually quite basic, and I'm sure I would go buy a nicer car for a few thousand dollars and maybe go on a small Amazon shopping binge, but I truly believe that I would stay pretty constrained in any shopping spree. 
If that is from being too nervous of making a huge mistake and losing all my money, then so be it. 

I think I would handle the opportunity of having two million dollars quite well, so if any of you want to give me the chance, please let me know. :)
