For the past few lessons we have covered a lot of verbs.
This week I'd like to switch it up and talk about some prepositions.
These are words like "for", "of", "to", "in", and "about", which end up getting used extensively in normal, everyday sentences.

So in German, of course, things have to be a bit structured so we have three types of prepositions, based on the case they need.
We have accusative prepositions, dative prepositions, and "either/or" prepositions, 
which use either the accusative or the dative case based on context.

Today we can cover the accusative prepositions and we'll save the rest for future lessons.

What would a German lesson be without a table?

| German | English |
|---------|--------|
| *bis* | until |
| *durch* | through |
| *f&uuml;r* | for |
| *gegen* | against |
| *ohne* | without |
| *um* | about, around, at |

So these mostly correspond 1:1 with an English preposition, which is quite helpful.
And I did say that these are accusative prepositions, so the words that are handled by the preposition have 
to be in the accusative case.
Sounds like sentence time! 

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I work until the next Friday. | *Ich arbeite bis den n&auml;chsten Freitag.* |
| You drive through the whole city. | *Du f&auml;hrst durch die ganze Stadt.* |
| We will work for you. | *Wir werden f&uuml;r dich arbeiten.* |
| The group had insurance against the damage. | *Die Gruppe hatte Versicherung gegen die Besch&auml;digung.* |
| She wants a sandwich without tomatoes. | *Sie will ein Sandwich ohne Tomaten.* |
| I will be there at 3. | *Ich werde um 3 Uhr da sein.* |

So now we now have an introduction to a new part of speech at our disposal to use and make our 
sentences more descriptive and complex. 
I hope you enjoyed this quick lesson and I hope you come back next time to learn even more prepositions!
