Next weekend I will be visiting a friend in Seattle, so there may or may not be a post. 

I thought I would take this time to mention some of the trips I would like to take at some point in my life. 
I want to make travel and exploration a regular part of my life, so here are some goals I have:

  * Travel to every continent (I have been to North America, Europe, and Asia so far)
  * Travel to all 50 U.S. states (I think I have been to maybe 10-15 so far)
  * Go to a World Cup soccer game (both men's and women's)
  * Go to the Cricket World Cup
  * Go to an Ashes Test match (cricket)
  * Go to all of the games in a World Series (USA baseball championship)
  * Go to Japan for a week or so
  * Go to the Olympics for a week or so
  * Travel around Germany again
  * Visit South Africa
  * Visit the Middle East
  * Visit Machu Picchu
  
I don't know if I can actually accomplish all of these trips, but I would certainly love to do so. 
I suppose it will just depend on my priorities as I "grow up" so to speak. 
I value my "freedom" to travel so I hope that I do not give it up too easily.
