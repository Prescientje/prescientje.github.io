title: "Why Everyone Should Study Abroad"

_Disclaimer:_

I do not believe that everyone should go to college, though “studying abroad” is usually done in college. 
I also do not necessarily believe that literally every person on the planet must study abroad.

_Now to the article..._

I was able to study abroad for my third year of university.
I moved from Indiana to Ulm, Germany to have a year of classes at Hochschule Ulm.
I had experience learning German in high school and in my previous two years of college so I was not entirely out of my element in Germany.
My classes were also taught in English, though I believe I could have handled a few of them in German (but it would have been more difficult for sure).
Overall there were both good and bad moments but my time abroad will be a lasting, happy memory that allowed me to grow and change as a person beyond what I could have expected.

First and foremost, living in a different culture for a year greatly improved my understanding of German.
If anyone is interested in learning a language, living in a culture that speaks that language is probably the best way to (be forced to) learn it.
My hearing comprehension improved the most, and I was also able to use the language regularly.

Secondly, I was also able to connect with and make friends with other students from a variety of cultures. 
There were students from countries such as South Korea, Finland, Mexico, Hungary, Cameroon, and Spain; 
I enjoyed really getting to know people from such diverse backgrounds. 
This process also gave me a better understanding of my own culture and how other countries see the U.S.

Finally, studying abroad gave me a chance to live on my own and grow up, so to speak. 
In my foreign exchange program, each student had an individual bedroom with shared bathroom and kitchen facilities. 
I was responsible for my own meals (there was a cafeteria at the campus but I decided to cook for myself instead). 
Because I also didn't have my regular friend group from my college in Indiana I had a lot of time to myself to be able to think about my life, read about a wide variety of topics, and also travel around Germany and the surrounding countries. 
I was able to learn so much about myself and think through what was important to me and what I want to do with my life. 
I was able to really get a foundation for my perspectives on life and solidify some of my thoughts and beliefs, and change some too.

I found my time abroad to be incredibly valuable. 
I believe that most people would greatly benefit from a similar type of experience. 
I cannot wait to go back to Germany and I do hope to be able to do some extensive travel throughout the world in the future.
