I have noticed a pervasive thought which seems to be running through society more and more recently, and that is the idea that someone else is supposed to take care of us.
Many people feel that the government should be doing something about whatever problem is occurring that day, or that the issue is someone else's problem, and so on.

For example, the government should pay for everyone's college. 
I am firmly against that idea, mainly because I believe that some people should not go for college, but also because we as individuals should be responsible for our own education. 
We should not be relying on taxation to provide for education.
There are several other arguments related to "college for all" that I won't get into now, but suffice it to say that I am completely opposed to the concept.

I want to be in charge of my life. 
I want to be able to take charge and make decisions and obviously seek advice and help when I need it, but principally I would like to determine my own path. 
I do not wish to have things just be "someone else's problem" and let life gradually get worse for everyone. 
We need to stand up for what we believe in and do our best to improve our world -- and do so now. 

With all of these centralized services provided by Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple, I am becoming increasingly concerned with people just wanting something to "work" and not caring about any side effects. 
I personally do not really like having things in the cloud and I try to limit 3rd-party services when I can.
You just have to look around and see all of these hacks and wonder about how safe having everything online is. 
I'm also worried about everyone constantly being on their phones and searching social media for satisfaction. 
I don't think that constantly looking a) at a screen and b) for validation is particularly healthy. 

I hope that if enough people speak out about these kinds of issues, we can start to change what we now consider "normal." 
All of this behavior has not been normal up until that past few decades. 
And even if society does gradually descend into madness, those who choose personal responsibility and action can create a better life for themselves.
