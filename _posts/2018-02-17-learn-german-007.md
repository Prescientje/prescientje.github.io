This time I would like to walk through the modal verbs.
These are very common verbs such as "to want to", "would like to", "can", and "should".
So let's cover the conjugation charts and then go to a few example sentences.

| to want | *wollen* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich will* | *wir wollen* |
| *du willst* | *ihr wollt* |
| *er/sie/es will* | *sie/Sie wollen* |

| would like to | *m&ouml;chten* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich m&ouml;chte* | *wir m&ouml;chten* |
| *du m&ouml;chtest* | *ihr m&ouml;chtet* |
| *er/sie/es m&ouml;chte* | *sie/Sie m&ouml;chten* |

| can | *k&ouml;nnen* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich kann* | *wir k&ouml;nnen* |
| *du kannst* | *ihr k&ouml;nnt* |
| *er/sie/es kann* | *sie/Sie k&ouml;nnen* |

| should | *sollen* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich soll* | *wir sollen* |
| *du sollst* | *ihr sollt* |
| *er/sie/es soll* | *sie/Sie sollen* |

| to be allowed to | *d&uuml;rfen* |
|---------|--------|
| *ich darf* | *wir d&uuml;rfen* |
| *du darfst* | *ihr d&uuml;rft* |
| *er/sie/es darf* | *sie/Sie d&uuml;rfen* |

Hopefully I have not completely overwhelmed you with verb conjugations. 
I hope that you noticed some similarities with the English equivalents. 
Unfortunately, one of the biggest "false friends" is given here with *wollen* not meaning *will* (as in the future tense).
That's something to keep in mind for sure (and I can let you know that the future tense verb is *werden*, but that's for another day).

So now we can get into sample sentences and illustrate one more important aspect of German sentence order: 
the conjugated verb always goes **second** and any other verbs go **to the end**.

So in English we can say "I always want to eat pizza". 

| I | always | want | to eat | pizza. |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| subject | adverb | conjugated verb | verb | object |

In German, the word order is switched around a little bit:

| Ich | will | immer | Pizza | essen. |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| subject | conjugated verb | adverb | object | verb |

We can also try it this way:

| Immer | will | ich | Pizza | essen. |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| adverb | conjugated verb | subject | object | verb |

So the conjugated verb always fits in the second position, and any other verbs go to the end.

Now let's look at some other sample sentences.

| English | German |
|---------|--------|
| I want to find the book. | *Ich will das Buch finden.* |
| You can see the dog. | *Du kannst den Hund sehen.* |
| They would like to give the dog a gift. | *Sie m&ouml;chten dem Hund ein Geschenk geben.* |
| We should sleep. | *Wir sollen schlafen.* |
| He wants to sleep. | *Er will schlafen.* |
| She can make a table. | *Sie kann einen Tisch machen.* |
| I am allowed to watch the movie. | *Ich darf den Film schauen.* |

So this week we've learned a key aspect of German word order and have begun to learn several commonly-used verbs. 
We have a great foundation to begin learning more specific German grammar topics and get into the nitty-gritty so to speak.
